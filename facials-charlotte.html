				<p class="button radius alert modalbutton">Show Me My Options</p>
				<p class="lead">There are many benefits to waxing versus other forms of hair removal. 
				  It is an effective method to remove large amounts of hair at one time. It is a long-lasting method. 
				  Waxing the hair will prevent regrowth for two to eight weeks. 
				  When hair is shaved or removed by depilatory cream, the hair is removed at the surface rather than the root. 
				  Within a few days, the hair can be seen at the surface. With these methods, hair tends to grow back in a rough stubble. 
				  Areas that are repeatedly subjected to waxing over long periods of time often exhibit regrowth that is softer.</p>
