		   <blockquote>I have been a client of Lorrie's for just a few months and am amazed at her expertise and how much she has done for my skin. 
		   She truly cares about your skin and not just making a buck.

		   <blockquote>I needed a miracle for my skin and I found it with Lorrie Emory. 
		   She has the best products and thanks to her wonderful skills my skin is looking great! 
		   She is also very sweet and makes you feel special in her very cozy room at Sola. 
		   Go see her...it's worth every penny!  She is also the best person I know for waxing and eye brow shaping!

		   <blockquote>I have been a client of Lori's for almost 5 years!  She is amazing!  You will not be disappointed. 
		   I always feel very comfortable and at ease.  She never runs behind on appointments and the pricing is perfect!!

		   <blockquote>I have been a client of Lorrie Emory's for over nine years. 
		   She consistently provides top of line services; 
		   I leave with radiant skin and amazing eyebrows each time. 
		   I would recommend her to anyone who is looking to build a professional relationship with someone you can trust.

		   <blockquote>Ms. Emory has done a fabulous job for me. Over this past year, I have had a wonderful monthly 
		   facial and microdermabrasion, leaving my skin much smoother and younger-looking.
		   During Easter, my mother remarked how good my skin looked, not having seen me since Christmas, so her methods definitely work! 
		   Ms. Emory has given me the best results I have ever had with facials and microdermabrasion.

		  <li>
		   <blockquote>I've been a client of Lorrie's for a decade and have followed her as she changed salons and started her own business! 
		   She is the best in town when it comes to waxing and facials, so much in fact, that ALL my girlfriends 
		   go to Lorrie (and their husband's love it!) I would seriously never go to anyone else for waxing. 
		   Plus, her facials are amazing! I've been to some top rated resort spas and Lorrie's facials are better, hands down! 
		   The hand and head/neck massages are an added plus to what is a wonderful facials experience and you leave with 
		   your skin glowing and looking younger! What's not to love? Go see her!
		   <cite>J S. Cornelius, NC</cite></blockquote>
		  </li>
		  <li>
		   <blockquote>I've been seeing Lorrie for years for waxing and skin care and I feel so lucky to have found her! 
		   She is an expert in her field, professional, kind, and easy going. 
		   She really gets to know your skin and her recommendations have always worked for me. I have extremely unruly eyebrows and anyone who hasn't been blessed with beautiful brows knows the mess someone can make of them. 
		   Ever since I started going to Lorrie for shaping I love the way they look. You don't get better than Lorrie.  
		   She is the best in the business!
